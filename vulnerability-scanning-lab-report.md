**Name:** Mukhtar Aliyu  
**Course:** Cisco NetAcad Cybersecurity  
**Lab:** Vulnerability Scanning and Analysis  

---

## 🎯 Objective

The purpose of this lab was to identify security weaknesses in a system using vulnerability scanning tools and to understand how vulnerabilities are categorized and reported.

---

## 🧠 What is Vulnerability Scanning?

Vulnerability scanning is the process of using automated tools to detect known security flaws, outdated software, and misconfigurations in systems and networks.

---

## 🖥 Lab Environment

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| System Used | Kali Linux Virtual Machine |
| Tool Used | OpenVAS / Nessus (specify) |
| Target | Authorized lab target system |

---

## ⚙️ Steps Performed

### 1️⃣ Configured the Scanner
- Installed and launched the vulnerability scanning tool.
- Updated vulnerability databases.

### 2️⃣ Defined the Target
- Entered the IP address of the authorized lab system.

### 3️⃣ Started the Scan
- Launched a full vulnerability scan.
- Allowed the scan to analyze services, ports, and configurations.

### 4️⃣ Reviewed Scan Results
- Identified detected vulnerabilities.
- Observed severity levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical).

## 🛠 Example Vulnerabilities Identified

| Vulnerability | Severity | Description |
|---------------|----------|-------------|
| Outdated Software | Medium | Older versions may contain known exploits |
| Open Ports | Low | Unnecessary services increase attack surface |
| Weak Configurations | High | Improper settings can allow unauthorized access |

---

## 📊 Understanding Severity Ratings

| Level | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Low | Minor risk |
| Medium | Moderate risk |
| High | Serious risk |
| Critical | Immediate security threat |

---

## 🧠 Skills Learned

- Running automated vulnerability scans  
- Understanding CVSS severity ratings  
- Analyzing scan reports  
- Recognizing system weaknesses  
- Basic security assessment workflow  

---

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

| Issue | Solution |
|------|----------|
| Long scan duration | Allowed scan to complete fully |
| False positives | Reviewed findings carefully |

---

## 🔐 Ethical Considerations

The scan was conducted only on authorized lab systems. No real-world systems were tested.

---

## ✅ Outcome

Successfully completed a vulnerability scan and understood how security tools detect weaknesses and report risk levels.

---

## 📌 Conclusion

This lab provided hands-on experience in vulnerability assessment and showed how security professionals identify and evaluate risks in systems.
